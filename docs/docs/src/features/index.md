# Features

As Declarai is aimed at being completely extensible and configurable, we provide interfaces to override and
interact with any of the default behaviours if you choose.

We are still actively working on exposing all the necessary interfaces to make this possible, so if there are any
interfaces you would like to see exposed, please vote or open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/vendi-ai/declarai/issues)
