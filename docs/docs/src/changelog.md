**Announcing the first release of Declarai!** ðŸ¥³ ðŸ¥³

Declarai was born out of the awe and excitement of LLMs, along with our passion for excellent engineering and real-world applications at scale.

We hope this project will help introduce more developers into the world of LLMs and enable them to more easily and reliably integrate these amazing capabilities into their production systems.

Main features:

  - Task interface
  - Chat interface
  - Middlewares
  - Exhaustive documentation
  - OpenAI support
  - LLM prompt best practices
